# This & Prototype Examples

In this repository, you will find some examples and exercises related to
JavaScript "this" and "prototype".

To write these examples, I used the excellent book 
"You don't know JS": this & Object prototypes" by Kyle Simpson. You can know more about this book
here: https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/1st-ed/this%20&%20object%20prototypes/README.md#you-dont-know-js-this--object-prototypes

## Examples

All of the examples and exercises are explained using tests with Jest. 
You need to run `npm install` before running them.
